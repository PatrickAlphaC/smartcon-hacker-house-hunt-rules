- There are 20 contracts with a “mintNft” or “mint_nft” function, find out how to mint each of the 20 NFTs
- Minting multiple NFTs from the same contract doesn’t get you extra points
- Contracts are unaudited, so if there is something that would prevent others from minting an NFT, let Patrick know
- No cheating allowed. Cheating is loosely defined. It can be anything from DDOSing competitors, attempting denial of service smart contract attacks, physically attacking other computers, etc. Patrick’s discretion.
- In order for your scores to count, you need to register your team on the registration contract
- There is a score function on the registration contract, that’s how you can know your score
- You are allowed to look at other people’s transactions
